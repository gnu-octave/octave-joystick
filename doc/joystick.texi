@chapter Installing and loading
@cindex Installing and loading

The Joystick toolkit must be installed and then loaded to be used.

It can be installed in @acronym{GNU} Octave directly from octave-forge,
or can be installed in an off-line mode via a downloaded tarball.

The toolkit has a dependency on the SDL library (@url{http://www.libsdl.org/}), so it must be installed in order
to successfully install the Joystick toolkit.

For Fedora: @code{yum install sdl2-devel} 

For Ubuntu: @code{apt install libsdl2-dev} 

The toolkit must be then be loaded once per each @acronym{GNU} Octave session in order to use its functionality.

@section Online Direct install
@cindex Online install
With an internet connection available, the Joystick package can be installed from
the octave-joystick website using the following command within @acronym{GNU} Octave:

@example
pkg install https://sourceforge.net/projects/octave-joystick/files/v@value{VERSION}/joystick-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz/download
@end example

The latest released version of the toolkit will be downloaded and installed.

@section Off-line install
@cindex Off-line install
With the Joystick toolkit package already downloaded, and in the current directory when running
@acronym{GNU} Octave, the package can be installed using the following command within @acronym{GNU} Octave:

@example
pkg install joystick-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
@end example

@section Loading
@cindex Loading
Regardless of the method of installing the Joystick toolkit, in order to use its functions,
the toolkit must be loaded using the pkg load command:

@example
pkg load joystick
@end example

The toolkit must be loaded on each @acronym{GNU} Octave session.

@node Basic Usage Overview
@chapter Basic Usage Overview
@cindex Basic Usage Overview

A list of available joysticks available can be obtained using the vrjoysticklist function.

@example
> vrjoysticklist 
id name                   forcefeedbacksupported
 1 logitech dual action   0
@end example

The ID value is then used to create a joystick object.
@example
> joy = vrjoystick(1)
joy =

  Joystick object
      ID: 1
    Name: Logitech Dual Action
@end example

The capabilities of the joystick can be read to determine number of axis and buttons are available.

@example
> caps(joy)
ans =

  scalar structure containing the fields:

    Axes = 4
    Buttons = 12
    POVs = 1
    Forces = 0
@end example

The axis and button states can be read for any axis or button number.

@example
> a1 = axis(joy, 1)
a1 = 0

> b1 = button(joy, 1)
b1 = 0
@end example
